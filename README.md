# RUN CMS

A very simple file based CMS running on PHP.
Heavily inspired by Kirby CMS.

PHP Codebase: https://github.com/moritzebeling/run-php
CMS Template: https://github.com/moritzebeling/run-cms

## Install

To get started, use this repository as template.

## Concept

RUN CMS should:

- be a filebased CMS system without admin panel
- provide a simple api to that filesystem
- be as high speed as possible
- be as low footprint as possible
- run on every machine with PHP > `7.3`
- be open source

The main goal for RUN CMS is, to deliver a data model obtained from a folder structure, which can be used within php templates or fetched by some JAM-Stack frontend website.

## Info

This project is currently in development, and should only be used for experiments. Contributions are welcome.
